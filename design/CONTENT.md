# design/ — page-level UX: layout, flow + UX patterns (fetched live from the web)

What lives here:
1. **Per-page UX decisions** — the layout/flow we settled on for a page, and why.
2. **Layout foundations** — the page recipe + the 3-tier law (how a page is composed).
3. **UX pattern lessons** — what the best course websites do, **fetched LIVE from the web** during
   brainstorm; the durable takeaways accumulate here. No static teardowns.

Siblings: `../ui/CONTENT.md` (the visual system — tokens/typography/spacing), `../decision/<block>.md`
(per-block decision logs), `../../cannon/CONTENT.md` (code rules).

## Layout foundations (page recipe + 3-tier law — from the design system)
To build a page that looks native: (1) pick the nearest **archetype** (Course detail / Course learn /
Challenge split); (2) reuse the frame — `max-w-[1280px]` container, `grid md:grid-cols-5` (3/2) or
`grid-cols-4` (sidebar), breadcrumbs on top; (3) build with **HeroUI v3**, no hand-rolled primitives;
(4) semantic tokens only (`bg-default/40`, `text-muted`, `color="accent"`) — good in both themes;
(5) reuse patterns (count/meta-chip `Chip size="sm" variant="soft" color="accent"` + Phosphor icon; outline
rail active = `text-accent bg-accent/10`; price VND primary + USD `text-muted` secondary; `MarkdownContent` +
Shiki); (6) i18n every string (next-intl); (7) data via GraphQL `query-*`/`mutation-*` + SWR hook.
**Don't:** hardcode hex, hand-roll button/modal/accordion, hardcode copy, px-locked layout, or forget dark.

**Content-column "parts" layout (law — 2026-06-21, supersedes the old `h-3`-between-tiers rule):**
Every content page = Breadcrumb → Header (`Heading level={3}` H3 + `body-sm muted` desc) → Content, but the
column is built as **stacked PARTS**, and:
- **Every part has its own `max-w` cap + `p-6` inner padding** (all parts share the same cap so they align left).
- **Separation between parts:** a `border`/`Divider` between two parts → each part stays `p-6` (the line
  separates). **No divider → use the GAP** (`gap-3` for related content, `gap-6` for two different content
  sections — see `../ui/gap.md`), not extra padding.
- Within a part, `gap-3`. Title↔description is `gap-0`. **`gap-8` is reserved for whole LAYOUT regions**
  (e.g. the two profile/dashboard columns), never between vertical content parts.

(Old rule was `h-3` spacers between tiers — replaced by the `p-6`/`p-8` part model above.) Personal
home/profile + dashboard use the **2-column shell** (identity/sections left+right) with **`gap-8`** between the
two sides — NOT a 3-rail layout.

## Per-page decisions
`<page>.md` (e.g. `lesson-reader.md`, `dashboard.md`) — the archetype chosen, the section order, the flow,
and **why**. Added/updated automatically at the end of `/starci-fe-ux-apply`.

## UX pattern lessons (from the web)
During brainstorm: **read this section first**, then `WebSearch`/`WebFetch` only what's missing, and append
the new lesson here at the end of the task.
